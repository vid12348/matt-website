I am a senior at **Applied Technology High School** with passions for engineering and computer science. I love starting new projects and learning new things. 

I am currently Interning at an IT Company called TNTMAX, where I am learning various valuable skills in the IT world.

Aside from technology, I enjoy skateboarding and playing video games.
