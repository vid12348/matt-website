#### This idea was created by [Justin Bongcaron](https://www.instagram.com/justinb.exe/), a classmate of mine. All of the models were made by him as well. The only original thing I did was the paint job and audio file. It is essentially me following his guide on how to make it.

The idea behind the project was to make a small speaker box in order to play an MP3 file the moment a car is started. Justin created the fusion models for this and put together a parts list on Amazon which I used. The Video of the device working is below, enjoy!
