## Let me start this by saying THIS WAS NOT MY ORIGINAL IDEA
### This idea was created by [Justin Bongcaron](https://www.instagram.com/justinb.exe/), a classmate of mine. All of the models were made by him as well. The only original thing I did was the paint job and audio file. It is essentially me following his guide on how to make it.

The idea behind the project was to make a small speaker box in order to play an MP3 file the moment a car is started. Justin created the fusion models for this and put together a parts list on Amazon which I used.

### Components:

1. [The main board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M35VHY5)  

Triggers when given power and plays an MP3 file through the attached speaker with a little bit of modification.

2. [The speaker itself](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XW2NPTG)  

Bigger and higher rated speaker = louder!


3. [The cable extension](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0134XUJN2)  

This is used to add a usb port to the outside of the device and make it a bit prettier rather than running a cable straight through the 3D printed chassis.


4. The 3D printed box  

Used a 3D model that Justin made.

1. The first step in making the device was 3D printing the chassis. I used my schools 3D printer (Ultimaker S5) to do so.

2. While the 3D print was going (It took round 40 hours if I remember correctly) I prepared the board and speaker. This was pretty much just removing the button and the speaker the circut board came with and bridging the connections that the button was originally connected to with a bead of solder. The only other thing I had to do was attach the larger speaker that I purchased on Amazon to the connections I removed the default speaker from.

3. After the box was fully printed, I did some test-fitting, sanding, and drilling to ensure that all of the parts fit where I wanted them to fit.

4. The third step I took, which was completely optional, was painting the 3D Printed box. I used Rust-Oleum red and black spraypaint and did two coats. I used red and black because I wanted to fit the theme I am going for with my car.

5. The fourth step is getting the MP3 file that I wanted to use. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to use an online text to speech generator and have it say *"Enjoy the ride!"*.

6. Once I had the MP3 file generated and downloaded, I just dragged and dropped my audio file into the box while it was plugged into my computer. (It appears as a USB storage device to a computer when plugged into a usb port).

7. As simple as that, I plugged it into the USB port in my car and it worked, saying *"enjoy the ride!"* the moment my engine started up.

### Big thanks again to [Justin](https://www.instagram.com/justinb.exe/) for coming up with this!
