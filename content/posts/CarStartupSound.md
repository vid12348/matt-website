## Let me start this by saying THIS WAS NOT MY ORIGINAL IDEA
### This idea was created by *Justin Bongcaron* and all of the models were made by him as well. The only original thing I did was the paint job and audio file. It is essentially me following his guide on how to make it.

The idea behind the project was to make a small speaker box in order to play an MP3 file the moment I start my car. Justin created the fusion models for this and put together a parts list on Amazon which I used.
